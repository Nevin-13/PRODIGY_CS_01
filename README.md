This is a cyber-sec related project done by myself with various references and self study materials for the completion of a task 
given as part of an virtual internship from Prodigy_Infotech. It is a python code which you can compile and run. The purpose of 
this program is to encrypt and decrypt plain text into cipher text and vice-versa using caesar cipher and a key of values starting from 1 to 26.
